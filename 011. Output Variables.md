### **Output Variables in Terraform**

Output variables are used to **display useful information** after running Terraform commands — typically after `apply`.
They can also be used to **pass data** between modules or to **reference resource attributes** elsewhere.

---

#### **Syntax:**

```hcl
output "<output_name>" {
  value       = <expression or resource.attribute>
  description = "Explanation of what this output represents"
  sensitive   = false
}
```

---

#### **Example:**

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "app_server" {
  ami           = "ami-123456"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "app"
  }
}

output "public_ip" {
  value       = aws_instance.app_server.public_ip
  description = "The public IP of the web server instance"
}
```

---

#### **Usage:**

* After running `terraform apply`, Terraform will print something like:

  ```
  Outputs:

  public_ip = "13.245.22.10"
  ```

* To get only outputs anytime:

  ```bash
  terraform output
  ```

* To get a specific one:

  ```bash
  terraform output public_ip
  ```

---

#### **Sensitive Outputs**

If your output contains passwords, secret keys, or tokens:

```hcl
output "db_password" {
  value     = var.db_password
  sensitive = true
}
```

Terraform will hide it from console output.

---

#### **Use Case in Modules** (will learn later)

Outputs are also how **child modules** return values to the **root module**.
Example:

```hcl
module "network" {
  source = "./network"
}

output "vpc_id" {
  value = module.network.vpc_id
}
```
