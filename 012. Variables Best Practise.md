### **Best Practice: Variable and Output Files**

To maintain clean, modular Terraform code, follow the **separation of concerns** principle.

#### **1. `variables.tf`**

* Define all **input variables** here.
* Keeps variable definitions organized and easy to locate.
* Example:

  ```hcl
  variable "region" {
    description = "AWS region to deploy resources"
    type        = string
    default     = "us-east-1"
  }
  ```

#### **2. `outputs.tf`**

* Define all **output variables** here.
* Keeps outputs isolated from resource definitions.
* Example:

  ```hcl
  output "public_ip" {
    description = "Public IP of the EC2 instance"
    value       = aws_instance.app_server.public_ip
  }
  ```

#### **3. `main.tf`**

* Contains all **resource definitions** (infrastructure code).
* Refers to variables and outputs defined in the other files.

Terraform automatically loads all `.tf` files in the directory, so splitting them this way is purely for clarity — not functionality.
