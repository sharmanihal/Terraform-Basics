### **Resource Naming and Referencing in Terraform**

#### **1. Resource Name in Terraform**

Example:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "app_server" {
  ami           = "ami-xxxxxxx"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

* The name **`app_server`** is **internal to Terraform**, not visible in the AWS Console.
* It acts as an **object identifier** within your Terraform code.
* Terraform uses it to track, reference, and manage this resource in the state file.

---

#### **2. Setting a Visible Name in AWS**

To make the instance name appear in the AWS Console, use **tags**:

```hcl
tags = {
  Name = "abc"
}
```

* This `Name` tag will be displayed in the AWS EC2 dashboard.
* You can add multiple tags for better resource identification and management.

---

#### **3. Referencing One Resource in Another**

Since `app_server` is an **object in Terraform**, you can use it to refer to this resource elsewhere in your code.
Example:

```hcl
resource "aws_eip" "app_eip" {
  instance = aws_instance.app_server.id
}
```

* Here, the Elastic IP (`app_eip`) references the EC2 instance (`app_server`) using its **ID**.
* This enables **resource dependency management** — Terraform knows to create the EC2 instance before assigning the EIP.
