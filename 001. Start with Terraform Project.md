### **Terraform Basics**

#### **1. Project Structure**

* A **Terraform project** is just a folder containing Terraform configuration files.
* The main file is typically named **`main.tf`**, which serves as the **entry point** for your Terraform code.
* Additional files can be added as needed (e.g., `variables.tf`, `outputs.tf`, `providers.tf`).

---

#### **2. Provider Configuration**

* A **provider** tells Terraform which cloud platform or service to interact with (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure).

**Example (HCL):**

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  profile = "default"
  region  = "us-west-2"
}
```

---

#### **3. Creating Resources**

* Resources define the actual infrastructure components Terraform will manage (e.g., EC2 instances, S3 buckets).

**Syntax:**

```hcl
resource "<provider>_<resource_type>" "<name>" {
  # configuration
}
```

**Example:**

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "app_server" {
  ami           = "ami-830c94e3"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

---

#### **4. Initializing Terraform**

Before running any commands, initialize the project directory:

```bash
terraform init
```

* This command downloads the necessary provider plugins.
* It creates:

  * `.terraform/` directory (stores provider binaries and modules)
  * `.terraform.lock.hcl` (locks provider versions for consistency)

---

#### **5. Planning the Execution**

Run:

```bash
terraform plan
```

* This command **previews** what Terraform will do.
* It compares the **current infrastructure** (state) with your **configuration files**.
* It shows whether Terraform will **create**, **update**, or **destroy** resources.

(Think of it as *checking the fridge before going grocery shopping* — seeing what you already have.)

---

#### **6. Applying the Plan**

Once satisfied with the plan, apply it:

```bash
terraform apply
```

* This command executes the plan and makes actual changes to your cloud infrastructure.
* Terraform recalculates the plan to ensure accuracy before applying.
* Terraform is **idempotent**, meaning if you run `terraform apply` again without changes, it won’t recreate existing resources.

#### **7. Key Concepts Recap**

| Command           | Purpose                                       |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `terraform init`  | Initialize the project and download providers |
| `terraform plan`  | Show what changes will be made                |
| `terraform apply` | Execute and apply the changes                 |
