### **Saving and Applying a Terraform Plan**

#### **1. Saving a Terraform Plan**

You can **save** the execution plan to a file to share or reuse it later:

```bash
terraform plan --out=myplan.tfplan
```

* This command generates a **binary plan file** (`myplan.tfplan`).
* The plan file contains all the actions Terraform intends to perform (create, modify, delete).
* Useful for **review**, **approval workflows**, or **team collaboration**, so others can see the exact plan before applying it.

---

#### **2. Applying a Saved Plan**

To apply the saved plan file, run:

```bash
terraform apply .\myplan.tfplan
```

* Terraform will **not re-run the plan step**; it will **directly execute** the actions described in the saved plan.
* Ensures that the **applied infrastructure** exactly matches the **approved plan** (no re-calculation or drift check at this stage).

| Command                              | Purpose                               |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| `terraform plan --out=myplan.tfplan` | Save the plan to a file               |
| `terraform apply .\myplan.tfplan`    | Apply the previously saved plan       |
| Direct `terraform apply`             | Recalculates the plan before applying |
