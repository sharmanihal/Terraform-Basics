### **Destroying and Removing Resources in Terraform**

#### **1. `terraform destroy` Command**

* The command:

  ```bash
  terraform destroy
  ```
* Goes through **all resources** managed by Terraform and **deletes them**.
* You **don’t need to modify** the `main.tf` file for this.
* It simply destroys everything that Terraform created as per the current state file.

#### **2. Removing Specific Resources**

If you want to remove **only one or a few resources** instead of everything:

1. **Delete** that specific resource block from your `.tf` file.
2. Run:

   ```bash
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```

   Terraform will detect that the resource is **no longer in the configuration** and will **destroy only that resource**, keeping the rest intact.
